## GNOMAD - A Visual Travel Blog

Gnomad was created to chart all the countries that you have travelled to, and represent them in a chosen color on a world map. I wanted to make a web-app version of a poster my friend had. It was set up so he could scratch off the countries he had travelled to and they became a brighter color. I think I accomplished that, plus more!

### Adding Countries

When you sign in for the first time, you will see a very boring world map. That's by design! The map becomes more and more colorful and interesting the more countries you add to it. You can also add your friends' traveled countries to your map, but we will get into that shortly.

Click on a country that you have been to and a popup will give you the option to either add this country to your 'visited list' or see all the posts for that country. The form is pretty straight forward to add it to your list. You can add images from your trip and write a description of your time there. You can also make reccomendations to other users who are looking into going to that country.

Viewing posts is just that, viewing all the posts made about that country. You can 'Like' posts and there is also some information about the country including the currency they use and the language they speak.

### Your Profile

You can access your profile by opening the sidebar menu and clicking on "Profile". This is where you can update your profile image, change the color that your visited countries show up on the map, and view all the posts that you have made.

### Friends

I wanted to make this a social experience that you can share with your friends, so I added a friends legend on the bottom right corner of the screen. This is where you can search for users by username and send them a friend request.

This area also allows you to see all your friends and toggle thier visited countries on and off of your map. By default, thier countries are colored according to the color they set for themselves, but you have the option to change the color they show up as on your map. You can also click on thier username to see thier profile page and see all posts that they have made or all images that they have posted.

### Notifications

In the sidebar there is a notifications bell that will show a red bubble if you have any pending friend requests. When you click on it you can accept friends requests at your discretion.
